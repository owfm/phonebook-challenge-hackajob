## Hackajob Phonebook Advanced Challenge

This is a small challenge project for the Hackajob website.

Run the app:

```
git clone https://github.com/owfm/phonebook-challenge-hackajob
cd phonebook-challenge-hackajob
yarn
yarn start
```

The app is build with React using CRA and simple styling with emotion. It is a basic CRUD app for a phonebook, allowing local editing, adding, and deleting of items. Also implemented is sorting and searching.

This app was coded in about 2 hours so the styling is basic!

Nice-to-have would have been address and phonenumber validation using yup or similar.
